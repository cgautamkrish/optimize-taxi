# optimize-taxi
I got my hands on a dataset(~ 1 million) of taxi fare transactions in NYC with fare breakdown, pickup/dropoff lat/longs etc. Using this, I want to find the conditions for the perfect taxi ride - for the driver. Most profitable route, best time to operate, best time/route to get large tips, pickup hotspots, perfect loitering spots etc.
